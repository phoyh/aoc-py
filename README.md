This repository contains my **revised** solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles in Python.

The top ingredients to these solutions are:
* My **original code** - optimized (i.e., *rushed*) for minimal *time-to-submission*.
* Deeper **insights** into the problem domain - gathered by pondering on the puzzle after submission.
	* This might improve the *complexity class* of the algorithm.
* Thorough **refactoring** aiming at *clean code*.
	* The solution is transformed into *unit tests* (for each star at least one test case).
	* *DRY:* Recurring logic is extracted into an *API module* (which has its own unit tests).
* A final double-check with the ideas floating around on the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) is also helpful. I might pick up some ideas from there.

My puzzle inputs are not part of this repository, as [stipulated by the rules](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying). Instead, they reside in a *private submodule*.

In case you wonder, my **personal statistics** (times, ranks, scores) are found [here](../aoc-stats/).
